    "Every once in a while, a python library is developed that has the potential of changing the landscape in the field of Deep Learning. PyTorch is one such library. In the past few months, I have been dabbling a bit in PyTorch. I have been blown away by how easy it is to grasp. Among the various deep learning libraries I have used till date – PyTorch has been the most flexible and effortless of them all.\n",

    "1. What we are doing here is taking the raw dataset and splitting into targets and features. Dividing by 255 makes each pixel value to scale between 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 255, which helps in training our model. This step in Machine Learning is generally known as Normalization. Then we split into train and test sets using sklearn's `train_test_split` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Converting the numpy arrays into PyTorch Tensors using `from_numpy` function. Don’t let the word “tensor” scare you. It is nothing more than a simple mathematical concept. Tensors are mathematical objects that generalize scalars, vectors and matrices to higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Batch size is set. The batch size is usually set between 64 and 256. The batch size does have an effect on the final test accuracy. One way to think about it is that smaller batches means that the number of parameter updates per epoch is greater. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. To pass our data into our PyTorch models we need to convert it to a PyTorch Dataset. A Tensor Dataset in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We have the training data loaded into trainloader and we can make an iterator with iter(trainloader) that can help us grab data. Later, we'll use this to loop through the dataset for training. Each time we can pull out data of the size of the batch that is defined."

You can access the weight and bias tensors once the network (net) is created with `net.hidden.weight` and `net.hidden.bias`.\n",

    "* This is why our output layer contains 10 outputs in the first place. \n",
    "* The ouputs of these 10 layers are in probabilities, we have to somehow convert them to a prediction which contains a digit.\n",
    "* This is where softmax comes in, what it does is pretty simple, **it takes the probabilities, finds the maximum probability for a certain input, and makes it 1 and making the rest of the outputs 0** that way we can get our predictions working. \n",

    "The most common method to reduce overfitting (outside of early-stopping) is dropout, where we randomly drop input units. This forces the network to share information between weights, increasing its ability to generalize to new data. Adding dropout in PyTorch is straightforward using the `nn.Dropout` module. In short, this means for every neuron there is a 20% chance that it is being ignored  all the time.\n",

    "**Activation Functions and why ReLU?**\n",
    "* The outputs of NNs are in linear form $\\mathbf{W}x + b$ with $\\mathbf{W}$ being the Weight matrix and $b$ being the bias matrix that is being learned (in order to give the right final output) across all the neurons, these are called parameters. There are usually millions of these parameters that are being learned in a deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So just taking these output values of each neuron is fine, the easiest way to build and train one, this activation is called Linear Activations where no transformation is applied. That means the linearity of neurons in unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In a neural network we do complex multiplication and summing operations of these values at each node, turns out that when we use a Linear Activation we cannot capture more complex information as we have no mechanism in place to control how much each neuron gets activated to learn the intricate features represented in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note that this can still be used if we are expecting the output to be continuous values. (Regression) But for us (Classification) as it turns out this won't be all that effective to use, so we move to non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-linear activations let the neurons learn more complex features from the data by letting these neurons have sensitivity to specific features. We won't be going around setting which neurons detect which features by the way, that's why we train the algorithms with the data, to come up with an architecture where we can capture these intricate features just by running a few rounds through the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Two of the popular activation functions are `sigmoid` and `tanh` which are common in Machine Learning. In short, the caveats of using them on Neural Networks is that they saturate easily, for example if we give it a large value, sigmoid will squish it between 0 and 1 and `tanh` between -1 and 1. Which means after a certain rounds of training we might not be able to show any more differentiation to adapt the weights to keep learning more complex features. Which means this is simply not good enough for Deep Neural Networks as we would have to do this a lot more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And also this may lead to Exploding Gradients problem or Vanishing Gradients problem which can completely ruin the ability of the Neural Network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So what `ReLU` does is very simple, it only gets activated for positive values. So why is it helpful? It is being linear half the times and non-linear half the times, making adaptation much easier while training. Also effectively ruling out some of the problems of `sigmoid` and `tanh`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In short, `ReLU` provides the necessary sensitivity as well as preventing easy saturation.\n"
